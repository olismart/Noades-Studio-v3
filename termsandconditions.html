					<h3>The Contract</h3>
					<p>The contract entered into is between J Hossack (the Owner) and the person paying for the studio (the Hirer). The contract is not effective until the required payment has been received and confirmation sent from the Owner to the Hirer.</p>
					<h3>Booking</h3>
					<p>Bookings cannot be accepted for persons under the age of 18 years. The Owners reserve the right to refuse entry.</p>
					<h3>Reservations</h3>
					<p>Provisional reservations can be accepted by telephone or email and must be confirmed within 7 days by the arrival of the required deposit. Provisional reservations will be cancelled after 7 days without further reference.</p>
					<h3>Damages deposit</h3>
					<p> The Hirer is required to provide a cheque for £250 as a deposit against any damage caused. The cheque is required to pick up the keys, and will be returned when the keys are returned to the Owner.</p>
					<h3>Payment</h3>
					<p>The non refundable deposit required is one third of the rental fee if the booking is made more than 6 weeks prior to the start of the rental. The balance will be due no less than 6 weeks before the holiday commencement. If the balance is not received within the time specified the Owner reserves the right to cancel the booking and retain the deposit. Bookings made within 6 weeks of the start of the holiday require payment in full at the time of booking.</p>
					<h3>Methods of payment</h3>
					<p> Cheques should be made payable to “J Hossack”. All payments must be in pounds sterling, by cheque or cash. For details regarding direct transfer please contact us.</p>
					<h3>Hire charges</h3>
					<p>The hire charges are fully inclusive of oil fired central heating, hot water, electricity, wifi, towels (for inside use only), linen, and a welcome hamper.</p>
					<h3>Extras</h3>
					<p>The Hirer will be invoiced on departure for any additional charges incurred. Immediate settlement is required.</p>
					<h3>Cancellation</h3>
					<p>Once a booking is confirmed the Hirer is responsible for the total cost of the holiday. Any cancellation must be made in writing.</p>
					<h3>Booking alterations</h3>
					<p>Any change by the Hirer in holiday dates will be subject to the agreement of the Owner. Any alteration to a booking by the Hirer will be subject to an administrative charge of £25.</p>
					<h3>Occupancy</h3>
					<p> 3pm on the first day of hire until 11am on the last day of hire. In no circumstances shall the number of occupants exceed two persons.</p>
					<h3>Care of the property</h3>
					<p> The Hirer agrees: (a) To be responsible for leaving the accommodation in good order and clean condition otherwise a cleaning charge will be levied. (b) To pay for any loss or damage however caused excluding reasonable wear and tear incurred during occupation. (c) To allow reasonable access to the owner or their representative if it is deemed necessary. </p>
					<h3>Unreasonable behaviour</h3>
					<p> If in the opinion of the Owner any person is not suitable to continue their occupation of the property because of unreasonable behaviour, damage or nuisance to other parties, the contract may be treated by the Owner as discharged and the Owner may repossess the property immediately. The Hirer will remain liable for the whole cost of hire and no refund shall be due.</p>
					<h3>Smoking</h3>
					<p>This is a non-smoking property.</p>
					<h3>Animals</h3>
					<p>None allowed.</p>
					<h3>Liability</h3>
					<p> The Owner cannot accept responsibility for any material loss, damage, additional expense or inconvenience directly or indirectly caused by or arising out of the property, its plumbing, heating, electrical services, or exceptional weather. No responsibility is accepted for loss or damage of property, vehicles or vehicle contents belonging to the Hirer or any member of the party during their occupancy.</p>
					<h3>Complaints</h3>
					<p> If in the opinion of the Hirer there are grounds for complaint, it is the duty of the Hirer to take it up with the Owner or the Owner’s representative as soon as is reasonably possible and in any event before departure to allow remedial action to be taken. It is specifically agreed that failure by the Hirer to notify the Owner of any complaint as soon as is reasonably possible the Owner will be entitled to refuse to entertain the complaint, irrespective of its merits.</p>
					<h3>Waiver</h3>
					<p>The failure of the Owner to enforce or exercise, at any time, or for any period of time, any term of, or any right pursuant to this Agreement does not constitute and shall not be construed as a waiver of such term or right.</p>
					<h3>Legal provisions</h3>
					<p>The construction, validity and performance of this Agreement is governed by the law of England and the parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the English Courts. The Hirer agrees that the Contract with the Owner is made at the Owners premises and that any proceedings between the parties shall be conducted in the County Court nearest to the Owner. </p>
